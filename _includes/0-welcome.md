**The SICTIAM's PSN is a platform that distributes online services from a variety of SaaS editors. It's underlying and strategic goal is to forge open, linked and reusable data thanks to the daily use of services.**

The SICTIAM's PSN platform is vastly based on the Ozwillo platform (formerly known as *Oasis*, due to the European project it was funded upon). Thus, the technical protocols described here are the same than the ones of the Ozwillo platform. That's also the reason why the Ozwillo word still appears in some places, even if the SICTIAM now operates its own version of the Ozwillo platform.

The principles are to remain:

- *provider agnostic*, meaning that any editor providing valuable and ethical services is welcome on services.sictiam.fr;
- *business agnostic*, meaning that no specific business concern will curve the platform implementation.

The outline of the documentation is as follows: (1) introduction to the platform architecture and semantics, (2) how to play with APIs — prerequesites, tools and recommendations — (3) thorough description of provisioning services and then (4) enabling user authentication to access these services, (5) introduction to the Datacore API and its live Playground which documents it, (6) reference of the API that has been exhibited in the previous sections.

**Contributions are welcome!** If you think this documentation could be improved, please <a href="https://github.com/SICTIAM/psn-doc/issues" target="_blank">open an issue</a> and describe the problem (about completeness, correctness, clarity...).
