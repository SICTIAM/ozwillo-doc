**Ozwillo is a platform that distributes online services from a variety of SaaS editors. It's underlying and strategic goal is to forge open, linked and reusable data thanks to the daily use of services.**

The Ozwillo platform was formerly known as *Oasis*, due to the European project it was funded upon.

Ozwillo principles are to remain:

- *provider agnostic*, meaning that any editor providing valuable and ethical services is welcome on ozwillo.com;
- *business agnostic*, meaning that no specific business concern will curve Ozwillo platform implementation.

The outline of the documentation is as follows: (1) introduction to Ozwillo architecture and semantics, (2) how to play with Ozwillo APIs — prerequesites, tools and recommendations — (3) thorough description of provisioning services and then (4) enabling user authentication to access these services, (5) reference of the API that has been exhibited in the previous sections.

**Contributions are welcome!** If you think this documentation could be improved, please <a href="https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-doc/issues" target="_blank">open an issue</a> and describe the problem (about completeness, correctness, clarity...). You may also directly fork and contribute to the documentation github <a href="https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-doc" target="_blank">repository</a>.
